 * PlayerMove class, this will handle the input of each player and allow them
 * to pick its position on the board, before placing the word it will validate
 * that it:
 * 1. Is connected to another word on the board, or is the first word and therefore connects to [7][7]
 * 2. Can be fit onto the board
 * 3. Can be made with the tiles in the players hand
